# Github-Project

Now that I am equipped with the knowledge and skills to work with GitHub UI and Git CLI, I will use these skills to create an open source project in Git, make changes to that project and make it available to the community. I will fork a GitHub repository, clone that repository to my local system, make changes to the local repository, commit the changes locally, push it back to my GitHub fork, and create a pull request to add my update to the original repository. This final assignment project is split into two parts.

# **BACKGROUD**
### Part 1 - GitHub UI
You recently got hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities to low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. You are asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey. You will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this course and create supporting documents for the open source project including code of conduct, and contributing guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.

### Part 2 - Git CLI
Congratulations on starting the journey with your company by creating an open source Simple Interest Calculator bash script on GitHub. Your changes have been accepted and merged and the company has created a new global repository for the teams to collaborate. Other developers have contributed to this repository over time. Your team has found a mistake in one of the markdown files. You are asked to fork this repository and fix the mistake by using Git CLI in the provided lab environment and open a pull request.
